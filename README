lib-helix
========


overview
========

`lib-helix` is the standard library for the kairo programming language, designed to provide essential functionality and utilities for building robust applications in kairo. this library serves as both a functional foundation and a reference point for developers working with the kairo language.

written primarily in kairo, `lib-helix` encapsulates core capabilities and integrates seamlessly with kairo-based projects. additionally, it includes unit tests and comprehensive documentation in mdx format, ensuring reliability and ease of use.


directory structure
===================

the library is organized into the following directories:

- `docs`: contains the mdx documentation files for the standard library. use these as a reference for understanding and leveraging kairo's capabilities.

- `pkgs`: houses the kairo standard library functions. this is the core of `lib-helix` and contains the implementations of various utilities and features.

- `scripts`: includes utility scripts such as the test runner (`test.py`) and other tools to streamline development and debugging.

- `libs`: contains c++ headers that are used internally to extend kairo's functionality. these are not part of the public api and are used to overcome current limitations in kairo's feature set.


running tests
=============

to validate the library, use the testing script provided:
```bash
python3 scripts/test.py
