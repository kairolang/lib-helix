kairo core
==========

overview
========

the `core/` directory is the backbone of the kairo runtime and language implementation. it is organized into components that enable runtime behavior, low-level functionality, and internal documentation. these components are critical for compiler and runtime correctness and should only be modified with a full understanding of their implications.

directory structure
===================

the directory contains three main components:

- **kairo core files**:
  - the root of `core/` contains runtime definitions written in kairo.
  - these files define fundamental runtime behavior, utilities, and compiler-assisted mechanisms that are automatically included in all kairo programs.

- **include/**:
  - contains c++ source and headers implementing low-level functionality necessary for the runtime and some language features.
  - files in this directory are not written in kairo and interact directly with the host system.
  - these components are critical for the correctness of the compiler and runtime system.

- **docs/**:
  - contains starlight-compliant documentation for the components in `core/` and `include/`.
  - serves as internal documentation for compiler and runtime developers.

functionality
=============

- **automatic inclusion**:
  - all kairo files in `core/` are included implicitly during compilation.
  - this ensures that runtime functionality and language mechanisms are universally available to kairo programs.

- **low-level integration**:
  - `include/` provides c++ implementations for operations that kairo itself cannot directly express, such as memory management primitives, ffi support, and certain platform abstractions.
  - the files in `include/` are as close to the hardware as possible while maintaining portability.

- **hierarchical design**:
  - the separation between kairo definitions and c++ code is intentional to maintain a clean abstraction boundary.
  - runtime and language-level changes are confined to `core/`, while system-level changes affect `include/`.

usage
=====

- **modification**:
  - the kairo runtime expects files in `core/` and `include/` to remain consistent with the compiler’s assumptions.
  - changes to these files can lead to unexpected runtime or compile-time behavior. do not modify them unless you are familiar with the compiler’s architecture and runtime model.

- **documentation**:
  - the `docs/` directory provides detailed references for developers maintaining or extending kairo. this includes details on how runtime definitions are exposed to the compiler.

contributing
============

developers contributing to `core/` should understand its impact on both the runtime and the compiler. changes to these files may have far-reaching consequences. ensure that any modifications are well-tested and documented.
